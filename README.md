# local-json-logger

## Motivation
when working with TS application without debugger or apps where I don't have debugger attached I want to view log but Console is really hard for me to read. I wanted a local app where I can send data in json and then visualize and filter out the data. This application does exactly the same for me.

## How to Use:
 - `yarn install` the package and start the application with `yarn start`.
 - now send data to `http://localhost:8765`.
 - open `http://localhost:8765`. You should be able to view the data view `jsoneditor`.
